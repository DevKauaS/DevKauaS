Hello, my name is Kau√£. I am 20 years old and work as a DevOps professional with extensive experience in technology.

I have a solid background in coding, including creating scripts and websites. However, my primary focus today lies in Cloud Computing, particularly with AWS. I specialize in project architecture and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.

I am passionate about leveraging modern tools and methodologies to optimize workflows and build scalable, reliable solutions in the cloud.
